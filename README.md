# Donation-and-Aid-Request-Management-System
This project aims to develop a digital platform that simplifies the management of donations and aid requests in an organized, transparent, and efficient manner. It is based on the Microservices architecture, which divides the system into small independent services, making development, maintenance, and scaling easier.
